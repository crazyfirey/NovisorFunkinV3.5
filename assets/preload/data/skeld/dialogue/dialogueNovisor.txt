:pav:normal:...
:pav:scared:AHHHHHHH
:pav:normal:Wait Shhhh, Did you know Novisor is on the lose and kill us all
:pav:pissed:Hey, Quit saying everything that I'm saying.
:pav:pissed:Me? You're the one who's copying
:pav:pissed:Stop, No you! Seriously!
:pav:pissed:DUDE STOP!
:v:confused:Fine, But mostly because I'm terrified of Novisor hunting us down and trapping us in this game forever
:pr:normal:So the rumors are true, huh?
:pr:normal:There really is a ghost wandering the halls of the Skeld looking for new victims?
:v:normal:Yeah. And not some regular ghost that helps do tasks and stuff.
:v:normal:A real legit ghost. A forgotten soul that wades here between our world and the afterline.
:b:normal:Hey guys!
:p:normal:Hey BF!
:b:normal:So what are you guys up to?
:p:normal:Nothing, Veteran is telling some of a legit ghost
:v:normal:It's Novisor, Player. Novisor!
:pr:normal:Oh ok
:p:normal:But have you known Novisor BF?
:b:confused:No?
:p:normal:Dang, I've never knew about Novisor!
:v:normal:That happened a long time ago, Novisor used to be a regular guy just like you or me.
:pab:normal:Really?
:pr:normal:I've never heard that part of the story before.
:p:excited:Hey BF, I need some groove for this!
:b:excited:Aight, it's on!
