:pr:normal:Oh.
:pr:normal:Woah.
:pr:confused:what a weird dream!
:pr:confused:I'm never gonna be able to go back to sleep after that.
:v:normal:Oh, yeah.
:v:normal:Hey dude.
:pr:confused:Veteran?
:pr:confused:What are you doing here?
:pr:confused:What am I doing here?
:v:normal:Looks like we're playing Among Us
:v:normal:as always.
:v:normal:Well, time to do our tasks.
:pr:normal:Hold on!
:pr:normal:aren't you the least bit concerned that we woke up inside the game?
:v:normal:Dude
:v:normal:I spend 18 hours a day playing this game. The way I see it, this just saved me a walk from my mom's computer.
:pr:normal:I'm not gonna question that
:pr:normal:But Veteran, let me ask you this
:pr:normal:What's the last thing you remember?
:v:normal:Hmm.
:v:normal:Well, I do remember someone standing exactly where you are right now
:v:normal:asking me what the last thing I remember is.
:pr:normal:Yeah. That was me
:pr:normal:just two seconds ago.
:v:normal:Oh! Right, right, right
:v:normal:Sorry, my memory is shot. I've taken quite a few knocks to the head. Really messed up the old noggin
:v:normal:I've got to stop hanging out under coconut trees so much. I'm basically a goldfish that speaks at this point. My child psychiatrist Barbara calls them "forgetsies"
:pr:confused:Why are you seeing a child psychiatrist?
:v:normal:Because they're half the price of regular ones, duh.
:v:normal:Drinks work very similarly to happy meals
:pr:normal:There's no way that's possibly true
:v:normal:Then how come every visit, I get to play with a brand new toy?
:pr:normal:Oh my god, Veteran.
:pr:confused:Look, something is very wrong here, I know it
:pr:confused:I feel like, like, someone is watching us
:v:normal:You mean, besides all of them?
:pr:confused:Uh Veteran
:pr:confused:that's just a crudely drawn picture.
:v:normal:You're one to talk
:b:normal:Hey what's going on
:p:normal:hey bf
:p:normal:im not in the mood, can i get vibes
:b:excited:yea sure
